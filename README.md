# COVID19 Prediction
## Using Kalman Filter to Predict Corona Virus Spread

This work  presents the implementation of an online real-time Kalman filter algorithm to predict the spread of COVID19 per given region.
Coronavirus (COVID19) has recently caused major worldwide concern.
As the number of coronavirus cases reportedly increases, the spread of COVID19 is a serious threat to global health. 
In this work, we will try to predict the spread of coronavirus for each one of the infected regions. 
Fitting time series analysis and statistical algorithms to produce the best short term and long term prediction. 
An adaptive online Kalman filter provides us very good one-day predictions for each region.

### Kalman Filter을 이용한 대한민국의 코로나19 확진자/사망자/완치자 예측

* 대한민국의 경우에 한정해서 Ran Kremer의 모델로 확진자 수 / 사망자 수 / 완치자 수의 경향을 예측해보려고 합니다.
